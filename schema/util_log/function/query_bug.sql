/**

Function query_bug is intended for including in SQL user functions or views to
log if the function/view is being queried from.

| Parameter                      | In/Out | Datatype   | Remarks                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| a_tag                          | in     | text       | The optional tag to log.                           |

NB this is defined as a PLpgSQL (vs. plain SQL) function, possibly because it
needs to be, but primarily to prevent the query optimizer from optimizing it
out of the query.

Queries can be logged using this function by including the function call in the
query definition. This is (potentially) useful for determining if a SQL user
function or view is actually being used.

While simpler,

```
    SELECT t0.
        FROM some_table_name t0
        WHERE ...
            AND util_log.query_bug ( 'optional tag' ) ;
```

appears to result in a logging entry for each tuple selected.

Using a CTE however,

```
    WITH qb AS (
        SELECT util_log.query_bug ( 'optional tag' ) AS x
    )
    SELECT t0.
        FROM some_table_name t0
        CROSS JOIN qb
        WHERE ...
            AND qb.x ;
```

appears to result in only one logging entry for each time the query is executed.
